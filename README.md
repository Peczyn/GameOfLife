## Java Game of Life Simulator

This project is a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. It simulates the evolution of cells in a grid based on simple rules.

### About Conway's Game of Life:
The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input needed. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The rules are as follows:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Features:
- Interactive visualization of Conway's Game of Life.
- Adjustable grid size and speed controls to observe cell evolution.
- Java Swing interface for easy interaction.

### How to Run:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peczyn/GameOfLife
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd GameOfLife
   ./run.sh
   ```

3. **Interact:**
   - Click on cells to toggle them alive
   - Adjust the grid size and simulation speed using the controls.
   - Click "Start" to begin the simulation.
   - Click "Stop" to pause the simulation.

### Example:
Here's a simple example of how it works:
